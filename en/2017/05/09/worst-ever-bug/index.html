  <h1>Worst Ever Qt Bug (for me!)</h1>

  <time datetime=2017-05-09T00:00:00Z class="post-date"></time>
  <p>I think Qt is one of the best software development frameworks. It has a nice GUI
library alongside with many other tools, provided as a neat and clean API. KDE
desktop environment is almost entirely based on Qt framework. I&rsquo;ve been using it
for a decade now, and I have successfully delivered dozens of projects &ndash; both
embedded and desktop &ndash; most of them only using Qt. Though starting from version
5.3, a tiny bug has appeared in the core library, that makes life difficult for
me: It is impossible to insert invisible characters in Qt&rsquo;s text engine. That is
you can&rsquo;t type ZWNJ, ZWJ, LRE, RLE and PDF characters. (I have described what
they in this post:
<a href="">Control Charachters and Bi-Directional Text</a>.
The effect of this bug is so huge that makes it impossible for me to use KDE or
any other application that uses Qt. To see how it didn&rsquo;t work for us, imagine
being unable to type, for example, &ldquo;space&rdquo; character in any application on your
operating system! In this post I am going to show a workaround and explain how
to fix this bug. It is already fixed in recent versions of Qt, though it is not
in official repositories yet. Fortunately, the workaround is very simple and
does not break anything. Finally I&rsquo;ll provide a patch for 5.9. Hope this helps
someone.</p>
<h2 id="the-bugfix-that-entailed-another-bug">The Bugfix That Entailed Another Bug</h2>
<p>Everything was going fine in Qt, until December 2013. That day someone reported
a bug regarding accent characters. Apparently he couldn&rsquo;t get combinational
character codes to work (for example SHIFT+Ü in German). This bug affected older
versions back to 5.2. The fix was simple: Add a filter code right at the text
entry level, to filter out all un-printable characters. That includes every
single control character that we use to format Persian, Arabic and all other
right-to-left texts, also two space chars (Zero Width Non-Joining Space, and
Zero Width Joining Space) that we use often in Persian text. In fact, you can&rsquo;t
spell proper Persian without ZWNJ at all. The fix was released with 5.4 and
still exists in 5.8. You can still insert those characters elsewhere (like
LibreOffice) and copy/paste them into your Qt application. But it is not a
pleasant experience at all!</p>
<h2 id="the-bugfix">The Bugfix</h2>
<p>The bug was reported by five or six people around the world, as expected, mostly
from middle-east.
<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-42074">QTBUG-42074</a> was reported in
October 2014 and is followd by
<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-55608">QTBUG-55608</a>,
<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-57302">QTBUG-57302</a>,
<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-57003">QTBUG-57003</a>, and also
<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-58364">QTBUG-58364</a>.
But the fix has not released till January 17th 2017! It will take another couple
of years till it makes it way through official repositories of the common
distributions (except for Arch Linux . Arch is crazy!) Currently the Qt version in
latest Ubuntu release is still 5.6.1. Next release will contain 5.7.1
apparently. Debian is even worse! RedHat is the worst regarding outdated
packages! So a workaround is necessary for now.</p>
<h2 id="unofficial-workarounds">Unofficial Workarounds</h2>
<p>Telegram uses a patch for they own software which fixes part of the problem.
They have resolved the problem with ZWNJ. We can use the same approach and add
all characters we need. As far as I researched, no Linux distro has released any
patches for this problem. So we need a patch on distro&rsquo;s package (not Qt
itself). I already done this and got some partially satisfying results. It works
well with widgets but not with, for example
<a href="https://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a>, which apparently has migrated to KF5. QtQuick
seems to be still problematic. My patch is based on Ubuntu, though it is also
applicable for Debian-based distros. Similar steps must be followed to provide
patches for other distributions as well.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, we must patch Qt Core library in Ubuntu package repository.
While patching, we must also comply to the Debian packaging rules so the final
package can be replaced with the system&rsquo;s one. So let&rsquo;s first download source code of QtCore:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ‌‌apt <span class="nb">source</span> libqt5core5a</code></pre></div>
<p>This command will download Qt Core library with all of the patches added by Ubuntu developers. That will be around 50~is megabytes. In the output of this command, the git repository location is also shown. We can use it later to submit our patch.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ Reading package lists... Done
Picking <span class="s1">&#39;qtbase-opensource-src&#39;</span> as <span class="nb">source</span> package instead of <span class="s1">&#39;libqt5core5a&#39;</span>

...</code></pre></div>
<p>So now we have the source code in path. There is no patches applied yet. At this
time there are about 50 patches by Ubuntu devs. I happen to know that the
infected source file is <code>qwidgettextcontrol.cpp</code> located at
<code>src/widgets/widgets/</code>. So I am going to change it and add my codes. It is of
grave importance that you do this the right way, or the final package will not
be recognised by the dpkg (debian package management backend). It should be
properly versioned and it also needs a ChangeLog entry as well.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ <span class="nb">cd</span> qtbase-opensource-src-5.5.1+dfsg/
$ <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">QUILT_PATCHES</span><span class="o">=</span>debian/patches
$ quilt push -a
File series fully applied, ends at patch debian/patches/fix-duplicate-qnam-finished.patch
$ quilt new fix-non-printable-filters-for-persian-keyboard

$ quilt add src/widgets/widgets/qwidgetlinecontrol.cpp
File src/widgets/widgets/qwidgetlinecontrol.cpp added to patch debian/patches/fix-non-printable-filters-for-persian-keyboard</code></pre></div>
<p>Running these commands, I mark my files to be <strong>tracked for changes</strong>. That
means when I am done, I can ask quilt system what have I done exactly. It
will provide me an standard patch file, containing exact changes I have made. Now I
can start modifying aforementioned files. You can see what are those changes at
the end of this post.</p>
<p>Now, to generate the actual patch, I run these two commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ quilt refresh
$ quilt pop -a</code></pre></div>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also need a ChangeLog entry. ChangeLog has a mundane syntax which if not
followed word-by-word can be a pain in the back. Fortunately, Debian provides a
tool to add ChangeLog entries. Using <code>dch -i</code> any ChangeLog file can be modified
properly with less effort. It will automatically add date and signature, and
even will open the editor for you, so you can edit your entry.</p>
<p>Our final change looks like below lines. Please note that the version is exactly
one patch-number above the official version.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">qtbase-opensource-src (5.5.1+dfsg-16ubuntu7.3) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

...</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally I am ready to compile and install the package. These commands will do so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ <span class="nv">DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</span><span class="o">=</span>nocheck debuild -us -uc -b -j10</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that I have disabled all of the automated tests by setting
<code>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</code> environment variable. Not doing so, I would have to wait a
long time for tests to finish. (It might be a good idea though!) I also set the
parallel compile degree to 10. As a rule of thumb, I always use 2 + number of
cores for parallel builds. After build is finished, I&rsquo;ll have your Debian
packages ready to be installed. Following commands will do so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ <span class="nb">cd</span> .. <span class="c1"># go up one level</span>
$ sudo debi <span class="c1"># install everything</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now I can write proper Persian in my Qt applications:</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="ps-patches">PS: Patches</h2>
<p>Well, the patch works like this: Provide a white-list of all characters that you need, and make exceptions for them while filtering. This way, the fix for 35724 will not be undone, while it&rsquo;s negative side effect will be resolved. The patch is this one. Hope this will help someone.</p>
