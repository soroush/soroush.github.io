      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that 15 years have passed since I wrote my first line of professional code as a software engineer. Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to work in a variety of roles, changing jobs four times and exploring different areas of the field. Most of my time has been spent on systems programming, embedded systems, and artificial intelligence—back when AI was still a niche interest rather than the buzzword it is today. My work has taken me through industries as varied as finance, defence, bio-medical, and now broadcasting, each with its own unique challenges and lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to take a step back and reflect on this journey—both the highs and the lows. What have I learned over these years? How has this profession shaped me, and where has it taken me, both personally and professionally? It feels like the right time to have an honest look at how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come and where I might be headed next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
