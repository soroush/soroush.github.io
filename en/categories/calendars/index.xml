      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Iranian general public, working with date and time in a computer system has always&#xA;been challenging. As opposed to - almost - entire population of the planet, we use a&#xA;different calendar system (actually a better one!) but computer systems are not&#xA;designed and developed with non-Gregorian calendaring in mind. So we always have&#xA;to use unconventional methods and hacks to provide functionality of&#xA;the official calendar of the country - Solar Hijri&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, for me the absence of the Solar Hijri calendar in Qt has always&#xA;been annoying. Whenever I wanted to work with date and time in my C++ GUI&#xA;applications, I had two options: Either use my own custom widgets (which where&#xA;not as good as Qt&amp;rsquo;s widgets), or simply use the Gregorian calendar (which is&#xA;annoying for the final user).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since version 4.6, right after I released Persian translation of Qt, I was&#xA;thinking of implementing the solar calendar for this&#xA;framework. Unfortunately, in that time it was not possible to implement it for&#xA;many reasons. However, I made some prototypes, but it did not make it to Qt5.&#xA;Qt5 had its own sad story, with the premature release of version 5.0; the&#xA;opportunity created by changing the major version was also missed.&#xA;Though finally, after 6 years and forgetting all about calendars, I had the&#xA;chance to implement the solar Hijri calendar for Qt 5.10. The final version has been&#xA;released with Qt 5.14 on December 12, 2019. This post describes challenges, and&#xA;the process of the work, and also the API itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://soroush.github.io/en/en/static/images/jalali.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;h4&gt;Running Example&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
